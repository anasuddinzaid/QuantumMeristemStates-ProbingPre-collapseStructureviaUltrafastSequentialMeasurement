## 🌿 Theory Summary (Words Only)

This paper conceptualizes quantum evolution as:

* A **branching growth structure**
* Where:

  * Unstable branches collapse early
  * Stable ones survive
  * Least-loss paths dominate
* The analogy is philosophical but used only to explain physics behavior, not biology
* Reality is the **final survivor of infinite branch competition**
* Collapse is a **pruning mechanism**
* No math, no engineering, no biological claims
* Academic quantum-foundations only

---

## Purpose

* Theory archive
* Authorship protection
* Future simulation expansion
